It varies culturally, geographically and historically. There are both positive and negative aspects of society, and it is always evolving."

        "content": "Quantum tunnelling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where a particle can \u201ctunnel\u201d through a potential barrier even though it doesn\u2019t have enough energy to overcome the barrier. This is possible because of the wave-like nature of particles on a very small scale. As a result, particles can exhibit a probabilistic behaviour to spontaneously pass through the barrier, as if they had passed through it via a tunnel. The phenomenon is crucial to many physical processes, including nuclear fusion, the function of electronic devices, and the stability of atoms."
